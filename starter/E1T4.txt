Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

the web application EC2 instance security group is configured in an insecure manner allowing any protocol connection 
from any ip adress on any port range , in this case the security group(WebAppSG) inbound rules should allow only the Application 
load balancer tcp connection on port 5000 , and that's it .

# Poor practice 2

the web application EC2 instance profile attached IAM Role has full access to any s3 bucket and that's a violation of the
least privilege principle , in this case the IAM Role should allow only access to the free recipe s3 bucket with specific
authorized operations . 


# Poor practice 3

the secret recipes s3 bucket has sensitive data and in our case the s3 bucket is not encrypted , so we need to activate 
default encryption to fix this security issue .
