# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1- Not allowing ssh connection on the application web server in security group inbound rules . 
2 - allowing only trusted ip addresses to connect to ssh port in security group inbound rules and remove ssh login with password.
3- install security tools on application web server such as Fail2Ban which will detect malicious activities and block attackers ip adresses .

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

the web application EC2 instance profile attached IAM Role has full access to any s3 bucket and that's a violation of the
least privilege principle , in this case the IAM Role should allow only access to the free recipe s3 bucket with specific
authorized operations . 

the secret recipes s3 bucket has sensitive data and in our case the s3 bucket is not encrypted , so we need to activate 
default encryption to fix this security issue .
