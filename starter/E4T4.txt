# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Placing the web application in private subnet will prevent the internet facing attack , but this require creating 
  VPC private  endpoints for S3 to allow the private instance to read from the s3 bucket .

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

VPC endpoints don't fix misconfigured IAM permissions , they provide an additional layer of security by allowing connection your VPC directly to supported AWS services, like S3, 
without going over the public internet but are not a substitute for proper permission settings.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

unfortunatly No, existing objects do not get affected by encryption, only new objects will be encrypted .

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the resources affected by changes in the previous steps via CLI or console will get to their original state.
